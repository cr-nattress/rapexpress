# Colorado Courier Co.

- **Website:** https://www.coloradocourier.co/
- **Tagline:** "Fast, reliable courier services in Denver metro" with coverage list of 60+ Front Range cities.

## Offering Snapshot
- Provides 4 delivery speeds (right away up to end of next business day). Rates start at $18 in-town, giving price transparency seldom seen among local couriers [Source](https://www.coloradocourier.co/).
- Coverage map includes Denver through Fort Collins with "limited service" to Colorado Springs; still relevant competitor for shippers with multi-city needs.
- Emphasizes digital experience: online intake, coverage list, and a dedicated "Business Solutions" section.

## Strengths
- Transparent pricing and clear service tiers appeal to SMBs who dislike opaque quote processes.
- Extensive coverage area lets them market to customers needing north-south distribution.

## Weaknesses vs Rap
- Limited mention of Colorado Springs-specific operations; Rap can own the Springs narrative.
- Website is minimalist but lacks detail on compliance, dispatch tech, or client stories—Rap can surpass with richer proof.

## Action Items for Rap Express
1. Publish baseline price ranges or sample rate cards to match transparency.
2. Provide interactive coverage map (Springs ↔ Denver ↔ Pueblo) to highlight geographic strength.
3. Feature case studies for multi-stop runs to counter their "business solutions" page.
