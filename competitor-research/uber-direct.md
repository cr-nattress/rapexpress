# Uber Direct (White-Label Delivery)

- **Website:** https://www.uber.com/us/en/b/courier-services/colorado-springs-co-us/
- **Model:** Last-mile delivery as a service; businesses plug into Uber’s driver network via dashboard, POS integration, or API.

## Features
- Same-day & express (<2 hours), next-day, and scheduled deliveries up to 30 days ahead [Source](https://www.uber.com/us/en/b/courier-services/colorado-springs-co-us/).
- Real-time tracking shared via SMS/email, branded or Uber-branded notifications, proof-of-delivery alerts.
- Fixed-fee pricing based on distance/speed/region; zero commission/marketplace fees; pay-per-delivery.
- Supports package, legal, and medical courier categories.

## Why It Matters
- Provides on-demand national scale—local businesses may test Uber before engaging a dedicated courier.
- Seamless software (API, POS plugins) sets expectation for instant ordering, transparent tracking.

## Rap Express Counterplay
1. Promote reliability, vetted employees, insurance, and compliance (Uber’s gig drivers lack specialized training).
2. Offer integration hooks (Zapier, API, portal) so tech-savvy clients can automate without leaving Rap.
3. Emphasize ability to move larger freight and scheduled multi-stop routes—Uber excels at small parcels only.
