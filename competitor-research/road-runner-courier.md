- Real-time tracking portal with proof of delivery confirmations.

## Strengths
- Appeals to clients needing dedicated vehicle (no milk runs). Good pitch for high-value freight or urgent legal/medical runs.
- Coverage includes resort towns (Vail, Breckenridge, Aspen, Telluride) which may attract outdoor/retail brands Rap doesn’t target yet.

## Opportunities for Rap Express
1. Offer “direct drive” upgrade tier with published SLA to keep pace.
2. Use mountain-town partners or highlight ability to hand off to partners for resort deliveries.
3. Emphasize personalized service + local dispatch vs their more templated marketing copy.
