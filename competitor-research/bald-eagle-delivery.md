- **Listings:** MapQuest (https://www.mapquest.com/us/colorado/bald-eagle-delivery-home-services-376775786), DOT #1689615 records, Yelp/Nextdoor entries.
- **Base:** 2513 Legend Terrace, Colorado Springs, CO 80920 (per Nextdoor); phone (719) 548-1287.

## Services
- Expedited freight, "hot shots" and LTL deliveries; will transport oversized retail purchases to homes/businesses locally or regionally (CO, KS, NM, NE, UT, WY) [Source](https://www.mapquest.com/us/colorado/bald-eagle-delivery-home-services-376775786).
- Provides home services (minor installations/repairs) alongside courier work—positioned as flexible logistics + handyman hybrid.
- Operates small fleet (DOT data shows 1 truck, 3 drivers) focused on intrastate non-hazmat loads.

## Strengths
- Willing to haul large/awkward items that smaller couriers avoid; sells "we'll move what you just bought" convenience.
- Regional reach beyond Colorado Springs may appeal to construction, oil & gas, or residential customers needing interstate transport.

## Weaknesses/Opportunities for Rap
- Limited scale and minimal digital presence; no online ordering or tracking.
- Mixed brand (delivery + home services) may confuse B2B shippers—Rap can position as pure-play professional courier.
- Rap Express can target big-box + furniture retailers with dedicated white-glove delivery offers to capture this niche at scale.
