# Trip-Savers Couriers

- **Website:** https://tripsavers.pro/
- **Founded:** 1984 (veteran-owned) with HQ at 309 E Fontanero St, Colorado Springs.

## Services & Target Segments
- Same-day, next-day, routine/scheduled delivery across Front Range (Colorado Springs, Denver metro, Pueblo, Canon City, Monument, Woodland Park, Falcon, Fountain, Manitou Springs).
- Industries served: title/escrow, legal, finance, real estate, inter-office, retail, restaurants, manufacturing, auto, residential, B2B/B2C, specialty [Source](https://tripsavers.pro/).
- Handles documents, print jobs, court filings, USPS pickups, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, lab items, and “custom/specialty items.”

## Differentiators
- Promises quote response **within 2 hours** plus 8 AM–6 PM phone coverage (Mon–Fri).
- Veteran-owned angle + broad service list may resonate with defense/military clients.
- Focused on adaptability (“some things we’ve never heard of”)—positions as flexible concierge service.

## Risks to Rap Express
- Similar founding story (1984) and local ownership; could siphon heritage narrative.
- Offers specific mention of legal & medical verticals plus USPS pickup; potential overlap with Rap’s bread-and-butter scheduled runs.

## Opportunities
1. Emphasize Rap Express’s larger fleet + technology stack (two dispatchers + Courier Complete) to contrast with Trip-Savers’ smaller operation.
2. Provide online scheduling/portal vs their manual quote flow to capture urgent clients faster.
3. Highlight weekend/after-hours capabilities (Trip-Savers lists only Mon–Fri) to differentiate.
