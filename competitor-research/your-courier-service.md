# Your Courier Service, LLC

- **Website:** https://www.ycs570.com/
- **Base:** 124 S El Paso St, Unit A, Colorado Springs (per Yelp listing).

## Offerings
- Markets itself as a **24/7, 365-day** courier partner with personalized delivery services and customer-controlled experience [Source](https://www.ycs570.com/).
- Certified medical specimen transport, pharmaceutical delivery, and cargo vans available.
- Provides third-party warehouse & logistics support plus U-Haul rentals—blending courier + storage + equipment rental.

## Positioning
- Heavy emphasis on round-the-clock availability and “true 24-hour service partner.”
- Appeals to healthcare clients needing specimen handling and to DIY movers needing transport solutions.

## Competitive Considerations
- 24/7 coverage is a differentiator; Rap Express currently advertises weekday dispatch only. Need to clarify after-hours/on-call program.
- Warehouse + U-Haul add-ons allow them to capture clients needing staging/storage; potential upsell territory for Rap (maybe partner with storage operators).

## Suggestions for Rap Express
1. Formalize and market after-hours STAT/on-call service to counter their 24/7 messaging.
2. Highlight online payment + portal to show better tech stack (YCS site is basic).
3. Explore partnerships for temporary storage or include “project logistics” offering to match their warehouse positioning.
