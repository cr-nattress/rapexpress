# Metrobi (Upcoming Platform)

- **Website:** https://metrobi.com/co/colorado-springs/
- **Status:** Not yet live in Colorado Springs; waitlist open.

## Model
- Tech platform connecting small businesses to "top-rated" independent couriers. Businesses name their price; Metrobi matches jobs using driver ratings/experience [Source](https://metrobi.com/co/colorado-springs/).
- Provides software for route optimization, team management, Shopify integration, API, and white-labeled delivery communications.
- Offers same-day, next-day, scheduled deliveries with real-time tracking, text/email notifications, and branded messaging.

## Threat Assessment
- Once launched, will appeal to SMBs that want flexible pay-as-you-go delivery without dedicated fleets—especially e-commerce or meal/dessert brands already using Shopify.
- Transparent driver-rating system and push notifications replicate Uber Eats-style experience.

## Opportunities for Rap Express
1. Emphasize trust, compliance, and insured employees vs. gig drivers.
2. Offer API/webhook integration or at least portal automation to neutralize their software advantage.
3. Highlight ability to handle regulated freight (medical, legal) and larger loads Metrobi’s gig drivers may not cover.
